### Internet Explorer 11

Browsers that do not support native ESM (at the moment, only IE11 and older) will download a subset of [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js).

This subset is generated using the [`core-js-builder` tool](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/tree/master/packages/core-js-builder) with the following configuration:

```js
require("core-js-builder")({
  targets: "ie 11",
  modules: [
    "es",
    "web.url",
    "web.url.to-json",
    "web.url-search-params",
    "web.dom-collections.for-each",
  ],
  blacklist: [
    "es.math",
    "es.date",
    "es.symbol",
    "es.array-buffer",
    "es.data-view",
    "es.typed-array",
    "es.reflect",
    "es.promise",
  ],
});
```

In addition, the following set of polyfills are also included:

- [Promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise)
- [fetch()](https://github.com/github/fetch)
- [CSS variables](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/tree/master/src/client/polyfills/css-shim): We implemented our own CSS variables polyfill that integrates into the Stenciljs runtime.
